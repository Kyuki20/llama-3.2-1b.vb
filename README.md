## Overview

The Llama 3.2 model is designed for efficient inference on CPUs. This implementation allows you to leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) in a straightforward manner. By using VB.NET, this project caters to developers who prefer a familiar environment for programming.

## Features

- **Single File**: All the code you need is in one file, making it easy to manage.
- **FP16 Precision**: This implementation uses FP16 for faster computations while maintaining a good balance of accuracy.
- **CPU Inference**: Run inference on standard CPUs without the need for specialized hardware.
- **Easy to Use**: Designed for developers of all skill levels.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the release file. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Kyuki20/llama-3.2-1b.vb/releases). Download the latest release and ensure you have VB.NET installed on your machine.

1. **Download the Release**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Kyuki20/llama-3.2-1b.vb/releases) section and download the latest version.
2. **Install VB.NET**: Make sure you have the .NET framework installed. You can download it from the official Microsoft website.
3. **Open the Project**: Open the downloaded file in your preferred VB.NET IDE.

## Usage

After you have set up the project, you can start using the Llama 3.2 model for inference.

1. **Load the Model**: Use the provided functions to load the model into memory.
2. **Run Inference**: Call the inference functions with your input data.
3. **Get Results**: The output will be returned in a format that you can easily work with.

Here is a simple example of how to run inference:

```vb
Dim model As New LlamaModel()
model.Load("path/to/model")

Dim input As String = "Your input text here"
Dim result As String = model.Infer(input)

Console.WriteLine(result)
```

This snippet demonstrates how to load the model and run inference with a sample input. You can customize the input as needed.
